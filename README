This is just my case study project to practise reactive programming paradigm with practical use of kafka streaming and cassandra db for storing 'warehouse' logging data.
It is currently completed for ~70%. I will submit a proper README as soon as it is 100% ready and might be useful for other people to practise similar things.  I will also provide detailed instructins how to setup clusters for kafka streaming engine, cassandra db, producers, consumers and fron-end angular web app, which uses non-blocking rxjs to display data from kafka and cassandra.
